## Abstract
![SiamMask_Abstract.png](https://i.loli.net/2019/11/27/GoOd5IRwKBQHZhT.png)    
As `abstract` of the paper, their work mainly dubbed a method called **SiamMask**, which foucused on **VOT**(visual object tracking) and semi-supervised **VOS**(video object segmentation). It improved the `offline training` by augmenting loss with a binary segmentatin task.   
> 1. It solely relies on a single bounding box **initialisation** and **produces** class-agnostic object mask and rotated bounding boxes.  
> 2. It yield a solid evidence that SiamMask is a new **state of the art** among **real-time** trackers.

## Problem Description
![SiamMask_PD.png](https://i.loli.net/2019/11/27/rKdO8AiWwNCIzLH.png) 
> It shows the **task** of SiamMask focused on and the **needs** for tacking this problem.

## Problem Solution
![SiamMask_PS.png](https://i.loli.net/2019/11/27/CaObXSwIFGtfEi6.png)  
> It shows improments on **Initialisation** and **outputs** for accuracy.  

## Conceptual Understanding  
![SiamMask_Schematic.png](https://i.loli.net/2020/01/03/xIu8fhOiVRpWDlc.png)
![SiamMask_CU.png](https://i.loli.net/2019/11/27/YoH1sdPFzbQnc3N.png)  
> It describes the whole **architecture** of SiamMask with three brach and two branch, which adds **mask branch** to original siamese network.

## Details of implementation
![SiamMask_Implementation.png](https://i.loli.net/2019/11/27/rinPNk4UtOSJ7Zf.png)   
> 1. **network architecture**: it consists of `backbone`, `head` and `mask refinement module`.  
> 2. **training**: it divides three parts to training respectively, including `FC`, `RPN` and `segmentation`.  
> 3. **inference**: it evaluated once per frame with `max scores`.  

### Architecture
More details can be found in paper.
> 1. **backbone**: it remains the first 4-th stage of `ResNet`, with adding `adjust layer` and depth-wise `cross-correlated`.  
![SiamMask_Backbone.png](https://i.loli.net/2020/01/03/xu1Um6jrt7NDByk.png)
> 2. **head**: The `conv5` block in both variants contains a normalisation layer and ReLU non-linearity while `conv6` only consists of a 1Ã—1 convolutional layer.  
![SiamMask_Head.png](https://i.loli.net/2020/01/03/qw1PkeFBaDiAfxK.png)
> 3. **refinement**: It merges low and high resolution features using multi- ple refinement modules made of `upsampling layers` and `skip connections`.
